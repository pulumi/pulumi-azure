+}
+```
+
+## Argument Reference
+
+The following arguments are supported:
+
+* `service_principal_id` - (Required) The ID of the Service Principal for which this password should be created. Changing this field forces a new resource to be created.
+
+* `value` - (Required) The Password for this Service Principal.
+
+* `end_date` - (Required) The End Date which the Password is valid until, formatted as a RFC3339 date string (e.g. `2018-01-01T01:02:03Z`). Changing this field forces a new resource to be created.
+
+* `key_id` - (Optional) A GUID used to uniquely identify this Key. If not specified a GUID will be created. Changing this field forces a new resource to be created.
+
+* `start_date` - (Optional) The Start Date which the Password is valid from, formatted as a RFC3339 date string (e.g. `2018-01-01T01:02:03Z`). If this isn't specified, the current date is used.  Changing this field forces a new resource to be created.
+
+
+## Attributes Reference
+
+The following attributes are exported:
+
+* `id` - The Key ID for the Azure Active Directory Service Principal Password.
+
+## Timeouts
+
+The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) for certain actions:
+
+* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Azure Active Directory Service Principal Password.
+* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the Azure Active Directory Service Principal Password.
+* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Azure Active Directory Service Principal Password.
+* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Azure Active Directory Service Principal Password.
+
+## Import
+
+Service Principal Passwords can be imported using the `object id`, e.g.
+
+```shell
+terraform import azurerm_azuread_service_principal_password.example 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
+```
+
+-> **NOTE:** This ID format is unique to this provider and is composed of the Service Principal's Object ID and the Service Principal Password's Key ID in the format `{ServicePrincipalObjectId}/{ServicePrincipalPasswordKeyId}`.

+The following attributes are exported:
+
+* `id` - The ID of the Connection Monitor.
+
+## Timeouts
+
+~> **Note:** Custom Timeouts are available [as an opt-in Beta in version 1.43 & 1.44 of the Azure Provider](/docs/providers/azurerm/guides/2.0-beta.html) and will be enabled by default in version 2.0 of the Azure Provider.
+
+The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) for certain actions:
+
+* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Connection Monitor.
+* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the Connection Monitor.
+* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Connection Monitor.
+* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Connection Monitor.
+
+## Import
+
+Connection Monitors can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.
+
+```shell
+terraform import azurerm_connection_monitor.monitor1 /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/mygroup1/providers/Microsoft.Network/networkWatchers/watcher1/connectionMonitors/monitor1

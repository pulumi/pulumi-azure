+
+Manages a Password associated with a Service Principal within Azure Active Directory.
+
+-> **NOTE:** If you're authenticating using a Service Principal then it must have permissions to both `Read and write all applications` and `Sign in and read user profile` within the `Windows Azure Active Directory` API.
+
+## Example Usage
+
+```hcl
+resource "azurerm_azuread_application" "example" {
+  name                       = "example"
+  homepage                   = "https://homepage"

+  available_to_other_tenants = false
+  oauth2_allow_implicit_flow = true
+}
+
+resource "azurerm_azuread_service_principal" "example" {
+  application_id = azurerm_azuread_application.example.application_id
+}
+
+resource "azurerm_azuread_service_principal_password" "example" {
+  service_principal_id = azurerm_azuread_service_principal.example.id
+  value                = "VT=uSgbTanZhyz@%nL9Hpd+Tfay_MRV#"
+  end_date             = "2020-01-01T01:02:03Z"
+}
+```
+
+## Argument Reference
+
+The following arguments are supported:
+
+* `service_principal_id` - (Required) The ID of the Service Principal for which this password should be created. Changing this field forces a new resource to be created.
+
+* `value` - (Required) The Password for this Service Principal.
+
+* `end_date` - (Required) The End Date which the Password is valid until, formatted as a RFC3339 date string (e.g. `2018-01-01T01:02:03Z`). Changing this field forces a new resource to be created.
+
+* `key_id` - (Optional) A GUID used to uniquely identify this Key. If not specified a GUID will be created. Changing this field forces a new resource to be created.
+
+* `start_date` - (Optional) The Start Date which the Password is valid from, formatted as a RFC3339 date string (e.g. `2018-01-01T01:02:03Z`). If this isn't specified, the current date is used.  Changing this field forces a new resource to be created.
+
+
+## Attributes Reference
+
+The following attributes are exported:
+
+* `id` - The Key ID for the Azure Active Directory Service Principal Password.
+
+## Timeouts
+
+The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) for certain actions:
+
+* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Azure Active Directory Service Principal Password.
+* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the Azure Active Directory Service Principal Password.
+* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Azure Active Directory Service Principal Password.
+* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Azure Active Directory Service Principal Password.
+
+## Import
+
+Service Principal Passwords can be imported using the `object id`, e.g.
+
+```shell
+terraform import azurerm_azuread_service_principal_password.example 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
+```
+
+-> **NOTE:** This ID format is unique to this provider and is composed of the Service Principal's Object ID and the Service Principal Password's Key ID in the format `{ServicePrincipalObjectId}/{ServicePrincipalPasswordKeyId}`.

+# azurerm_connection_monitor
+
+Configures a Connection Monitor to monitor communication between a Virtual Machine and an endpoint using a Network Watcher.
+
+~> **NOTE:** This resource has been deprecated in favour of the `azurerm_network_connection_monitor` resource and will be removed in the next major version of the AzureRM Provider. The new resource shares the same fields as this one, and information on migrating across [can be found in this guide](../guides/migrating-between-renamed-resources.html).

+~> **NOTE:** This Resource requires that [the Network Watcher Agent Virtual Machine Extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/connection-monitor) is installed on the Virtual Machine before monitoring can be started. The extension can be installed via [the `azurerm_virtual_machine_extension` resource](virtual_machine_extension.html).
+
+## Argument Reference
+
+The following arguments are supported:
+
+* `name` - (Required) The name of the Connection Monitor. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
+
+* `network_watcher_name` - (Required) The name of the Network Watcher. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
+
+* `resource_group_name` - (Required) The name of the resource group in which to create the Connection Monitor. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
+
+* `location` - (Required) Specifies the supported Azure location where the resource exists. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
+
+* `auto_start` - (Optional) Specifies whether the connection monitor will start automatically once created. Defaults to `true`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
+
+* `interval_in_seconds` - (Optional) Monitoring interval in seconds. Defaults to `60`.
+
+* `source` - (Required) A `source` block as defined below.
+
+* `destination` - (Required) A `destination` block as defined below.
+
+* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.
+
+---
+
+A `source` block contains:
+
+* `virtual_machine_id` - (Required) The ID of the Virtual Machine to monitor connectivity from.
+
+* `port` - (Optional) The port on the Virtual Machine to monitor connectivity from. Defaults to `0` (Dynamic Port Assignment).
+
+A `destination` block contains:
+
+* `virtual_machine_id` - (Optional) The ID of the Virtual Machine to monitor connectivity to.
+
+* `address` - (Optional) IP address or domain name to monitor connectivity to.
+
+* `port` - (Required) The port on the destination to monitor connectivity to.
+
+~> **NOTE:** One of `virtual_machine_id` or `address` must be specified.
+
+## Attributes Reference
+
+The following attributes are exported:
+
+* `id` - The ID of the Connection Monitor.
+
+## Timeouts
+
+~> **Note:** Custom Timeouts are available [as an opt-in Beta in version 1.43 & 1.44 of the Azure Provider](/docs/providers/azurerm/guides/2.0-beta.html) and will be enabled by default in version 2.0 of the Azure Provider.
+
+The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) for certain actions:
+
+* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Connection Monitor.
+* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the Connection Monitor.
+* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Connection Monitor.
+* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Connection Monitor.
+
+## Import
+
+Connection Monitors can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.
+
+```shell
+terraform import azurerm_connection_monitor.monitor1 /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/mygroup1/providers/Microsoft.Network/networkWatchers/watcher1/connectionMonitors/monitor1

[More information is available in this GitHub issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/issues/11231) - however unfortunately this may necessitate a breaking change to the CDN and Front Door resources, more information will be posted [in the GitHub issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/issues/11231) as the necessary changes are identified.
-
-!> **BREAKING CHANGE:** The `custom_https_provisioning_enabled` field and the `custom_https_configuration` block have been removed from the `azurerm_frontdoor` resource in the `v2.58.0` provider due to changes made by the service team. If you wish to enable the custom HTTPS configuration functionality within your `azurerm_frontdoor` resource moving forward you will need to define a separate `azurerm_frontdoor_custom_https_configuration` block in your configuration file.
-
-!> **BREAKING CHANGE:** With the release of the `v2.58.0` provider, if you run the `apply` command against an existing Front Door resource it **will not** apply the detected changes. Instead it will persist the `explicit_resource_order` mapping structure to the state file. Once this operation has completed the resource will resume functioning normally.This change in behavior in Terraform is due to an issue where the underlying service teams API is now returning the response JSON out of order from the way it was sent to the resource via Terraform causing unexpected discrepancies in the `plan` after the resource has been provisioned. If your pre-existing Front Door instance contains `custom_https_configuration` blocks there are additional steps that will need to be completed to successfully migrate your Front Door onto the `v2.58.0` provider which [can be found in this guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/2.59.0/docs/guides/2.58.0-frontdoor-upgrade-guide).

Subject: [PATCH] Make shared features config optional

SharedFeatures config added in https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/commit/f860827bcb64a4f6f97274e6ee276dd54b9bd4e2
Modified in fork in https://github.com/pulumi/terraform-provider-azurerm/commit/6ac9e0b5ff9d72272d76f311a7665c03b12cb722

This originally included a conditional block to only set the SharedFeatures config if it had a value but this seems to have been lost during the provider config being refactored in https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/commit/57bcf134131514ffcc962f20b12f993fad7d6060#diff-58d6a027753b50994deb7e11e4a99dde423f35844986019bd9cea5e0c94aba22

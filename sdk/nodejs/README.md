The Microsoft Azure provider package offers support for all Azure services and their properties.
Services are exposed as types from modules such as `appinsights`, `compute`, and `storage`, among many others. Using this
package allows you to programmatically declare instances of any Azure services using infrastructure as code, which
Pulumi then uses to drive the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) API.

If this is your first time using this package, these two resources may be helpful:

* [Azure Getting Started Guide](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/quickstart/azure): Get up and running quickly.
* [Azure Pulumi Setup Documentation](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/quickstart/azure/configure/): How to configure Pulumi
    for use with your Azure account.

Use the navigation below to see detailed documentation, including sample code, for each of the supported Azure services.

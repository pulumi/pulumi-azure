/**
 * Manages a Key Vault.
 *
 * ## Disclaimers
 *
 * > **Note:** It's possible to define Key Vault Access Policies both within the `azure.keyvault.KeyVault` resource via the `accessPolicy` block and by using the `azure.keyvault.AccessPolicy` resource. However it's not possible to use both methods to manage Access Policies within a KeyVault, since there'll be conflicts.
 *
 * > **Note:** It's possible to define Key Vault Certificate Contacts both within the `azure.keyvault.KeyVault` resource via the `contact` block and by using the `azure.keyvault.CertificateContacts` resource. However it's not possible to use both methods to manage Certificate Contacts within a KeyVault, since there'll be conflicts.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azure from "@pulumi/azure";
 *
 * const current = azure.core.getClientConfig({});
 * const example = new azure.core.ResourceGroup("example", {
 *     name: "example-resources",
 *     location: "West Europe",
 * });
 * const exampleKeyVault = new azure.keyvault.KeyVault("example", {
 *     name: "examplekeyvault",
 *     location: example.location,
 *     resourceGroupName: example.name,
 *     enabledForDiskEncryption: true,
 *     tenantId: current.then(current => current.tenantId),
 *     softDeleteRetentionDays: 7,
 *     purgeProtectionEnabled: false,
 *     skuName: "standard",
 *     accessPolicies: [{
 *         tenantId: current.then(current => current.tenantId),
 *         objectId: current.then(current => current.objectId),
 *         keyPermissions: ["Get"],
 *         secretPermissions: ["Get"],
 *         storagePermissions: ["Get"],
 *     }],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Key Vault's can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import azure:keyvault/keyVault:KeyVault example /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/mygroup1/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/vault1
 * ```

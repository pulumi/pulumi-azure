/**
 * Use this data source to access information about an existing Version of a Shared Image within a Shared Image Gallery.
 * 
 * > **NOTE** Shared Image Galleries are currently in Public Preview. You can find more information, including [how to register for the Public Preview here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/blog/announcing-the-public-preview-of-shared-image-gallery/).
 * 
 * ## Example Usage
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azure from "@pulumi/azure";
 * 
 * const test = pulumi.output(azure.compute.getSharedImageVersion({
 *     galleryName: "my-image-gallery",
 *     imageName: "my-image",
 *     name: "1.0.0",
 *     resourceGroupName: "example-resources",
 * }));

/**
 * Manages a subnet. Subnets represent network segments within the IP space defined by the virtual network.
 *
 * > **NOTE on Virtual Networks and Subnet's:** This provider currently
 * provides both a standalone Subnet resource, and allows for Subnets to be defined in-line within the Virtual Network resource.
 * At this time you cannot use a Virtual Network with in-line Subnets in conjunction with any Subnet resources. Doing so will cause a conflict of Subnet configurations and will overwrite Subnets.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azure from "@pulumi/azure";
 *
 * const example = new azure.core.ResourceGroup("example", {
 *     name: "example-resources",
 *     location: "West Europe",
 * });
 * const exampleVirtualNetwork = new azure.network.VirtualNetwork("example", {
 *     name: "example-vnet",
 *     addressSpaces: ["10.0.0.0/16"],
 *     location: example.location,
 *     resourceGroupName: example.name,
 * });
 * const exampleSubnet = new azure.network.Subnet("example", {
 *     name: "example-subnet",
 *     resourceGroupName: example.name,
 *     virtualNetworkName: exampleVirtualNetwork.name,
 *     addressPrefixes: ["10.0.1.0/24"],
 *     delegations: [{
 *         name: "delegation",
 *         serviceDelegation: {
 *             name: "Microsoft.ContainerInstance/containerGroups",
 *             actions: [
 *                 "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/join/action",
 *                 "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/prepareNetworkPolicies/action",
 *             ],
 *         },
 *     }],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Subnets can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import azure:network/subnet:Subnet exampleSubnet /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/mygroup1/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/myvnet1/subnets/mysubnet1
 * ```

/**
 * Manages an Azure Management Group Policy Remediation.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azure from "@pulumi/azure";
 *
 * const exampleGroup = new azure.management.Group("example", {displayName: "Example Management Group"});
 * const example = azure.policy.getPolicyDefintion({
 *     displayName: "Allowed locations",
 * });
 * const exampleGroupPolicyAssignment = new azure.management.GroupPolicyAssignment("example", {
 *     name: "exampleAssignment",
 *     managementGroupId: exampleGroup.id,
 *     policyDefinitionId: example.then(example => example.id),
 *     parameters: JSON.stringify({
 *         listOfAllowedLocations: {
 *             value: ["East US"],
 *         },
 *     }),
 * });
 * const exampleGroupPolicyRemediation = new azure.management.GroupPolicyRemediation("example", {
 *     name: "example",
 *     managementGroupId: exampleGroup.id,
 *     policyAssignmentId: exampleGroupPolicyAssignment.id,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## API Providers
 *
 * <!-- This section is generated, changes will be overwritten -->
 * This resource uses the following Azure API Providers:
 *
 * * `Microsoft.Management` - 2021-10-01
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Policy Remediations can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import azure:management/groupPolicyRemediation:GroupPolicyRemediation example /providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/my-mgmt-group-id/providers/Microsoft.PolicyInsights/remediations/remediation1
 * ```

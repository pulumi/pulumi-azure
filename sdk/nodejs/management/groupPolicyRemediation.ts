/**
 * Manages an Azure Management Group Policy Remediation.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azure from "@pulumi/azure";
 *
 * const exampleGroup = new azure.management.Group("exampleGroup", {displayName: "Example Management Group"});
 * const examplePolicyDefintion = azure.policy.getPolicyDefintion({
 *     displayName: "Allowed locations",
 * });
 * const exampleGroupPolicyAssignment = new azure.management.GroupPolicyAssignment("exampleGroupPolicyAssignment", {
 *     managementGroupId: exampleGroup.id,
 *     policyDefinitionId: examplePolicyDefintion.then(examplePolicyDefintion => examplePolicyDefintion.id),
 *     parameters: JSON.stringify({
 *         listOfAllowedLocations: {
 *             value: ["East US"],
 *         },
 *     }),
 * });
 * const exampleGroupPolicyRemediation = new azure.management.GroupPolicyRemediation("exampleGroupPolicyRemediation", {
 *     managementGroupId: exampleGroup.id,
 *     policyAssignmentId: exampleGroupPolicyAssignment.id,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Policy Remediations can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import azure:management/groupPolicyRemediation:GroupPolicyRemediation example /providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/my-mgmt-group-id/providers/Microsoft.PolicyInsights/remediations/remediation1
 * ```

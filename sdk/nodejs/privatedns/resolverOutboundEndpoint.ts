/**
 * Manages a Private DNS Resolver Outbound Endpoint.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azure from "@pulumi/azure";
 *
 * const example = new azure.core.ResourceGroup("example", {
 *     name: "example-resources",
 *     location: "west europe",
 * });
 * const exampleVirtualNetwork = new azure.network.VirtualNetwork("example", {
 *     name: "example-vnet",
 *     resourceGroupName: example.name,
 *     location: example.location,
 *     addressSpaces: ["10.0.0.0/16"],
 * });
 * const exampleSubnet = new azure.network.Subnet("example", {
 *     name: "outbounddns",
 *     resourceGroupName: example.name,
 *     virtualNetworkName: exampleVirtualNetwork.name,
 *     addressPrefixes: ["10.0.0.64/28"],
 *     delegations: [{
 *         name: "Microsoft.Network.dnsResolvers",
 *         serviceDelegation: {
 *             actions: ["Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/join/action"],
 *             name: "Microsoft.Network/dnsResolvers",
 *         },
 *     }],
 * });
 * const exampleResolver = new azure.privatedns.Resolver("example", {
 *     name: "example-resolver",
 *     resourceGroupName: example.name,
 *     location: example.location,
 *     virtualNetworkId: exampleVirtualNetwork.id,
 * });
 * const exampleResolverOutboundEndpoint = new azure.privatedns.ResolverOutboundEndpoint("example", {
 *     name: "example-endpoint",
 *     privateDnsResolverId: exampleResolver.id,
 *     location: exampleResolver.location,
 *     subnetId: exampleSubnet.id,
 *     tags: {
 *         key: "value",
 *     },
 * });

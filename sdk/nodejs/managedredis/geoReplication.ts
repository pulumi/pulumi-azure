/**
 * Manages Managed Redis Geo-Replication by linking and unlinking databases in a geo-replication group.
 *
 * > **Note:** This resource manages the geo-replication group membership for Managed Redis databases. All databases to be linked must have `geoReplicationGroupName` provided with the same value. Linking will [discard cache data and cause temporary outage](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/redis/how-to-active-geo-replication#add-an-existing-instance-to-an-active-geo-replication-group).
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azure from "@pulumi/azure";
 *
 * const example = new azure.core.ResourceGroup("example", {
 *     name: "example-managedredis",
 *     location: "West Europe",
 * });
 * const amr1 = new azure.managedredis.ManagedRedis("amr1", {
 *     name: "example-managedredis-amr1",
 *     resourceGroupName: example.name,
 *     location: "West Europe",
 *     skuName: "Balanced_B3",
 *     defaultDatabase: {
 *         geoReplicationGroupName: "example-geo-group",
 *     },
 * });
 * const amr2 = new azure.managedredis.ManagedRedis("amr2", {
 *     name: "example-managedredis-amr2",
 *     resourceGroupName: example.name,
 *     location: "Central US",
 *     skuName: "Balanced_B3",
 *     defaultDatabase: {
 *         geoReplicationGroupName: "example-geo-group",
 *     },
 * });
 * const exampleGeoReplication = new azure.managedredis.GeoReplication("example", {
 *     managedRedisId: amr1.id,
 *     linkedManagedRedisIds: [amr2.id],
 * });
 * ```

 * ## API Providers
 *
 * <!-- This section is generated, changes will be overwritten -->
 * This resource uses the following Azure API Providers:
 *
 * * `Microsoft.Cache` - 2025-07-01
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Managed Redis Database Geo-Replication can be imported using the Managed Redis `resource id`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import azure:managedredis/geoReplication:GeoReplication example /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/group1/providers/Microsoft.Cache/redisEnterprise/cluster1
 * ```

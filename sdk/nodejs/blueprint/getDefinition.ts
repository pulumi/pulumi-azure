 * Use this data source to access information about an existing Azure Blueprint Definition
 *

 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azure from "@pulumi/azure";
 *
 * const current = azure.core.getClientConfig({});
 * const root = current.then(current => azure.management.getGroup({
 *     name: current.tenantId,
 * }));
 * const example = root.then(root => azure.blueprint.getDefinition({
 *     name: "exampleManagementGroupBP",
 *     scopeId: root.id,
 * }));
 * ```

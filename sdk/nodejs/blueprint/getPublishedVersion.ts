 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azure from "@pulumi/azure";
 *
 * const current = azure.core.getSubscription({});
 * const test = current.then(current => azure.blueprint.getPublishedVersion({
 *     scopeId: current.id,
 *     blueprintName: "exampleBluePrint",
 *     version: "dev_v2.3",
 * }));
 * ```

/**
 * Use this data source to access information about a built-in Role Definition. To access information about a custom Role Definition, please see the `azurerm_role_definition` data source instead.
 * 
 * > **NOTE:** The this datasource has been deprecated in favour of `azurerm_role_definition` that now can look up role definitions by name. As such this data source will be removed in version 2.0 of the AzureRM Provider.
 * 
 * ## Example Usage
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azure from "@pulumi/azure";
 * 
 * const contributor = pulumi.output(azure.role.getBuiltinRoleDefinition({
 *     name: "Contributor",
 * }));
 * 
 * export const contributorRoleDefinitionId = contributor.id;
 * ```

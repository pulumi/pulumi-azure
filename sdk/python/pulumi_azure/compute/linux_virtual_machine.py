        ## Disclaimers

        > **Note** This provider will automatically remove the OS Disk by default - this behaviour can be configured using the `features` configuration within the Provider configuration block.

        > **Note** This resource does not support Unmanaged Disks. If you need to use Unmanaged Disks you can continue to use the `compute.VirtualMachine` resource instead.

        > **Note** This resource does not support attaching existing OS Disks. You can instead capture an image of the OS Disk or continue to use the `compute.VirtualMachine` resource instead.

        > In this release there's a known issue where the `public_ip_address` and `public_ip_addresses` fields may not be fully populated for Dynamic Public IP's.

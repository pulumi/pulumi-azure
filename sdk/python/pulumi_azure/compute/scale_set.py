            * `protocol` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Specifies the protocol of listener
        
        The **plan** object supports the following:
        
          * `name` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Specifies the name of the image from the marketplace.
          * `product` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Specifies the product of the image from the marketplace.
          * `publisher` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Specifies the publisher of the image.
        
        The **rolling_upgrade_policy** object supports the following:
        
          * `maxBatchInstancePercent` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The maximum percent of total virtual machine instances that will be upgraded simultaneously by the rolling upgrade in one batch. As this is a maximum, unhealthy instances in previous or future batches can cause the percentage of instances in a batch to decrease to ensure higher reliability. Defaults to `20`.
          * `maxUnhealthyInstancePercent` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The maximum percentage of the total virtual machine instances in the scale set that can be simultaneously unhealthy, either as a result of being upgraded, or by being found in an unhealthy state by the virtual machine health checks before the rolling upgrade aborts. This constraint will be checked prior to starting any batch. Defaults to `20`.
          * `maxUnhealthyUpgradedInstancePercent` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The maximum percentage of upgraded virtual machine instances that can be found to be in an unhealthy state. This check will happen after each batch is upgraded. If this percentage is ever exceeded, the rolling update aborts. Defaults to `20`.
          * `pauseTimeBetweenBatches` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The wait time between completing the update for all virtual machines in one batch and starting the next batch. The time duration should be specified in ISO 8601 format for duration (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations). Defaults to `0` seconds represented as `PT0S`.
        
        The **sku** object supports the following:
        
          * `capacity` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - Specifies the number of virtual machines in the scale set.
          * `name` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Specifies the name of the image from the marketplace.
          * `tier` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Specifies the tier of virtual machines in a scale set. Possible values, `standard` or `basic`.
        
        The **storage_profile_data_disks** object supports the following:
        
          * `caching` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Specifies the caching requirements. Possible values include: `None` (default), `ReadOnly`, `ReadWrite`.
          * `create_option` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Specifies how the data disk should be created. The only possible options are `FromImage` and `Empty`.
          * `disk_size_gb` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - Specifies the size of the disk in GB. This element is required when creating an empty disk.
          * `lun` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - Specifies the Logical Unit Number of the disk in each virtual machine in the scale set.
          * `managedDiskType` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Specifies the type of managed disk to create. Value must be either `Standard_LRS`, `StandardSSD_LRS` or `Premium_LRS`.
        
        The **storage_profile_image_reference** object supports the following:
        
          * `id` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Specifies the ID of the (custom) image to use to create the virtual
            machine scale set, as in the example below.
          * `offer` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Specifies the offer of the image used to create the virtual machines.
          * `publisher` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Specifies the publisher of the image.
          * `sku` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Specifies the SKU of the image used to create the virtual machines.
          * `version` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Specifies the version of the image used to create the virtual machines.
        
        The **storage_profile_os_disk** object supports the following:
        
          * `caching` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Specifies the caching requirements. Possible values include: `None` (default), `ReadOnly`, `ReadWrite`.
          * `create_option` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Specifies how the data disk should be created. The only possible options are `FromImage` and `Empty`.
          * `image` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Specifies the blob uri for user image. A virtual machine scale set creates an os disk in the same container as the user image.
            Updating the osDisk image causes the existing disk to be deleted and a new one created with the new image. If the VM scale set is in Manual upgrade mode then the virtual machines are not updated until they have manualUpgrade applied to them.
            When setting this field `os_type` needs to be specified. Cannot be used when `vhd_containers`, `managed_disk_type` or `storage_profile_image_reference` are specified.
          * `managedDiskType` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Specifies the type of managed disk to create. Value must be either `Standard_LRS`, `StandardSSD_LRS` or `Premium_LRS`.
          * `name` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Specifies the name of the image from the marketplace.
          * `os_type` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Specifies the operating system Type, valid values are windows, linux.
          * `vhdContainers` (`pulumi.Input[list]`) - Specifies the vhd uri. Cannot be used when `image` or `managed_disk_type` is specified.

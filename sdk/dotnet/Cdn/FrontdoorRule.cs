    /// ## Specifying IP Address Ranges
    /// 
    /// When specifying IP address ranges in the `SocketAddressCondition` and the `RemoteAddressCondition` `MatchValues` use the following format:
    /// 
    /// Use `CIDR` notation when specifying IP address blocks. This means that the syntax for an IP address block is the base IP address followed by a forward slash and the prefix size For example:
    /// 
    /// * `IPv4` example: `5.5.5.64/26` matches any requests that arrive from addresses `5.5.5.64` through `5.5.5.127`.
    /// * `IPv6` example: `1:2:3:/48` matches any requests that arrive from addresses `1:2:3:0:0:0:0:0` through `1:2:3:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff`.
    /// 
    /// When you specify multiple IP addresses and IP address blocks, `OR` logic is applied.
    /// 
    /// * `IPv4` example: if you add two IP addresses `1.2.3.4` and `10.20.30.40`, the condition is matched for any requests that arrive from either address `1.2.3.4` or `10.20.30.40`.
    /// * `IPv6` example: if you add two IP addresses `1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8` and `10:20:30:40:50:60:70:80`, the condition is matched for any requests that arrive from either address `1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8` or `10:20:30:40:50:60:70:80`.

    /// 
    /// ## Action Server Variables
    /// 
    /// Rule Set server variables provide access to structured information about the request. You can use server variables to dynamically change the request/response headers or URL rewrite paths/query strings, for example, when a new page load or when a form is posted.
    /// 
    /// ### Supported Action Server Variables
    /// 
    /// | Variable name | Description |
    /// |---------------|-------------|
    /// | `SocketIp`      | The IP address of the direct connection to Front Door Profiles edge. If the client used an HTTP proxy or a load balancer to send the request, the value of `SocketIp` is the IP address of the proxy or load balancer. |
    /// | `ClientIp`      | The IP address of the client that made the original request. If there was an `X-Forwarded-For` header in the request, then the client IP address is picked from the header. |
    /// | `ClientPort`    | The IP port of the client that made the request. |
    /// | `Hostname`       | The host name in the request from the client. |
    /// | `GeoCountry`    | Indicates the requester's country/region of origin through its country/region code. |
    /// | `HttpMethod`    | The method used to make the URL request, such as `GET` or `POST`. |
    /// | `HttpVersion`   | The request protocol. Usually `HTTP/1.0`, `HTTP/1.1`, or `HTTP/2.0`. |
    /// | `QueryString`   | The list of variable/value pairs that follows the "?" in the requested URL. For example, in the request `http://contoso.com:8080/article.aspx?id=123&amp;title=fabrikam`, the `QueryString` value will be `id=123&amp;title=fabrikam`. |
    /// | `RequestScheme` | The request scheme: `Http` or `Https`. |
    /// | `RequestUri`    | The full original request URI (with arguments). For example, in the request `http://contoso.com:8080/article.aspx?id=123&amp;title=fabrikam`, the `RequestUri` value will be `/article.aspx?id=123&amp;title=fabrikam`. |
    /// | `SslProtocol`   | The protocol of an established TLS connection. |
    /// | `ServerPort`    | The port of the server that accepted a request. |
    /// | `UrlPath`       | Identifies the specific resource in the host that the web client wants to access. This is the part of the request URI without the arguments. For example, in the request `http://contoso.com:8080/article.aspx?id=123&amp;title=fabrikam`, the `UriPath` value will be `/article.aspx`. |
    /// 
    /// ### Action Server Variable Format
    /// 
    /// Server variables can be specified using the following formats:
    /// 
    /// * `{variable}` - Include the entire server variable. For example, if the client IP address is `111.222.333.444` then the `{client_ip}` token would evaluate to `111.222.333.444`.
    /// 
    /// * `{variable:offset}` - Include the server variable after a specific offset, until the end of the variable. The offset is zero-based. For example, if the client IP address is `111.222.333.444` then the `{client_ip:3}` token would evaluate to `.222.333.444`.
    /// 
    /// * `{variable:offset:length}` - Include the server variable after a specific offset, up to the specified length. The offset is zero-based. For example, if the client IP address is `111.222.333.444` then the `{client_ip:4:3}` token would evaluate to `222`.
    /// 
    /// ### Action Server Variables Support
    /// 
    /// Action Server variables are supported on the following actions:
    /// 
    /// * `RouteConfigurationOverrideAction`
    /// * `RequestHeaderAction`
    /// * `ResponseHeaderAction`
    /// * `UrlRedirectAction`
    /// * `UrlRewriteAction`

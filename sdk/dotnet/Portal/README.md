A Pulumi package for creating and managing Microsoft Azure cloud resources, based on the Terraform azurerm provider. We recommend using the [Azure Native provider](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-azure-native) to provision Azure infrastructure. Azure Native provides complete coverage of Azure resources and same-day access to new resources and resource updates.

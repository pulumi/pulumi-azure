At this time, if the `AppResourceGroupName` is different from the Resource Group where SAP Single Node Virtual Instance exists, you can set `PreventDeletionIfContainsResources` to `False` to delete all resources defined in the HCL Configuration and the resources created in the `AppResourceGroupName` with `terraform destroy`. However, if the `AppResourceGroupName` is the same with the Resource Group where SAP Single Node Virtual Instance exists, some resources, such as the subnet defined in the HCL Configuration, cannot be deleted with `terraform destroy` since the resources defined in the HCL Configuration are being referenced by the SAP system/component. In this case, you have to manually delete the SAP system/component before deleting the resources in the HCL Configuration.

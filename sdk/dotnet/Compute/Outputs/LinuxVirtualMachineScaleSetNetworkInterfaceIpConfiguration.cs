Alternatively, you may use the `public_ip_prefix_id` field to generate instance-level IPs in a virtual machine scale set as well. The zonal properties of the prefix will be passed to the Virtual Machine instance IPs, though they will not be shown in the output. To view the public IP addresses assigned to the Virtual Machine Scale Sets Virtual Machine instances use the **az vmss list-instance-public-ips --resource-group `ResourceGroupName` --name `VirtualMachineScaleSetName`** CLI command.

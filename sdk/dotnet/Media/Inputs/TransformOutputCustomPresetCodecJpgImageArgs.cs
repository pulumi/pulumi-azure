If this value is `1`, it means only producing one thumbnail at start time), or a relative value to the stream duration (For example, `50%` to stop at half of stream duration from start time). The default value is `100%`, which means to stop at the end of the stream.

Also supports a macro `{Best}`, which tells the encoder to select the best thumbnail from the first few seconds of the video and will only produce one thumbnail, no matter what other settings are for `step` and `range`.

Note: Step value will affect the first generated thumbnail, which may not be exactly the one specified at transform preset start time. This is due to the encoder, which tries to select the best thumbnail between start time and Step position from start time as the first output. As the default value is `10%`, it means if stream has long duration, the first generated thumbnail might be far away from the one specified at start time. Try to select reasonable value for Step if the first thumbnail is expected close to start time, or set Range value at `1` if only one thumbnail is needed at start time.

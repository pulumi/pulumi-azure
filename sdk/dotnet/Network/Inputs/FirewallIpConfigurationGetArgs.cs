        /// &gt; **Note:** When multiple `ip_configuration` blocks with `public_ip_address_id` are configured, `pulumi up` will raise an error when one or some of these `ip_configuration` blocks are removed. because the `public_ip_address_id` is still used by the `firewall` resource until the `firewall` resource is updated. and the destruction of `azure.network.PublicIp` happens before the update of firewall by default. to destroy of `azure.network.PublicIp` will cause the error. The workaround is to set `create_before_destroy=true` to the `azure.network.PublicIp` resource `lifecycle` block. See more detail: destroying.md#create-before-destroy

        /// &gt; **Note:** When multiple `IpConfiguration` blocks with `PublicIpAddressId` are configured, `pulumi up` will raise an error when one or some of these `IpConfiguration` blocks are removed. because the `PublicIpAddressId` is still used by the `Firewall` resource until the `Firewall` resource is updated. and the destruction of `azure.network.PublicIp` happens before the update of firewall by default. to destroy of `azure.network.PublicIp` will cause the error. The workaround is to set `create_before_destroy=true` to the `azure.network.PublicIp` resource `Lifecycle` block. See more detail: destroying.md#create-before-destroy

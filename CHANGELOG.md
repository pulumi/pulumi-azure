CHANGELOG
=========

## HEAD (Unreleased)
* BREAKING: Default data type of a Storage Queue-triggered Callback Function is changed from 'binary' to 'string'.
  This means that the type of second argument of a callback changes from 'Buffer' to 'string' or 'object' depending on the payload.
  To restore the past behavior, pass `dataType: "binary"` to the arguments of `QueueFunction` class or `queue.onEvent` function.
* Support Input and Output bindings for callback-based Azure Functions (HTTP and Storage Queue/Blob/Table only)
* Introduce `listHostKeys` and `listFunctionKeys` mix-in functions to retrieve Azure Functions management keys

* Serverless mixins now support the EventHubTrigger for IoT Hub.
* Update to v1.30.0 of the AzureRM Terraform provider

## 0.18.5 (2019-05-26)
* Update to v1.29.0 of the AzureRM Terraform provider

## 0.18.4 (2019-05-22)
* Update the Pulumi-Terraform bridge, fixing an issue where all resources were marked as needing recreation in some cases

## 0.18.3 (2019-05-21)
* Add support for Event Hubs, CosmosDB and Timer triggers to serverless mixins
* Add extension-level host settings in serverless functions
* Fix bug #2511, which resulted in crashes when updating many properties of an `azure.containerservice.KubernetesCluster`
* Fix a bug where omitting a location would result in the initial failure of `pulumi preview`
* Update to v1.28.0 of the AzureRM Terraform provider
* Relax the maximum length of names on several resource types

## 0.18.2 (2019-05-06)
* Update the Pulumi-Terraform bridge, adding non-null assertions to many properties in the TypeScript definitions for the Node.js SDK

## 0.18.1 (2019-04-30)
* Update to v1.27.1 of the AzureRM Terraform provider
* Add support for authenticating with , , and
* Add support for authenticating with `clientCertificatePassword`, `clientCertificatePath`, and `partnerId`
* Add 'serverless' functionality in line with `@pulumi/aws`. Specifically:
  1. You can now easily create a FunctionApp from a JavaScript/TypeScript function using azure.appservice.CallbackFunctionApp.
  2. Subscribing and responding to HTTP events can be done easily with the new `azure.appservice.HttpEventSubsription` component. Custom routing is supported.
  3. You can subscribe to `azure.eventhub.Topic` events, invoking a FunctionApp containing the code you want, using `topic.onEvent(...)`.
  4. You can subscribe to `azure.storage.Container` blob events, invoking a FunctionApp containing the code you want, using `container.onBlobEvent(...)`.
  5. You can subscribe to `azure.storage.Queue` events, invoking a FunctionApp containin the code you want, using `queue.onEvent(...)`.
* The location for each resource attached to a provider instance is now set as part of the provider configuration. This means that the following code from v0.18.0:

  ```ts
  const rg = new azure.core.ResourceGroup("rg", { location" EastUS" });
  const sa = new azure.storage.Account("storage", {
      resourceGroupName: rg.name,
      location: "EastUS",
  });
  ```
  can now be written as:
  ```ts
  const rg = new azure.core.ResourceGroup("rg");
  const sa = new azure.storage.Account("storage", {
      resourceGroupName: rg.name,
  });
  ```
  Location can then be set using the provider configuration block if using first class providers, or, for the default provider, by running:
  ```
  pulumi config set azure:location EastUS
  ```

## 0.18.0 (2019-04-22)
* Update to v1.25.0 of the AzureRM Terraform provider

## 0.17.3 (2019-03-19)
* Fix a bug where setting a property value back to a default value results in no change
* Resources can no longer be "adopted" by accident during creation if another resource with the same ID already exists. This is the equivalent of enabling `ARM_PROVIDER_STRICT` in the AzureRM Terraform provider
* Project numeric types in Python as `float` instead of `int`, fixing some crashes

## 0.17.2 (2019-03-11)
* Update to v1.23.0 of the AzureRM Terraform provider

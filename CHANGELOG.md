## 0.18.1 (Unreleased)

- `@pulumi/azure` gets 'serverless' functionality in line with `@pulumi/aws`.  Specifically:
  1. You can now easily create a FunctionApp from a JavaScript/TypeScript function using
     azure.appservice.CallbackFunctionApp.
  2. Subscribing and responding to HTTP events can be done easily with the new
     `azure.appservice.HttpEventSubsription` component.
  3. You can subscribe to `azure.eventhub.Topic` events, invoking a FunctionApp containing the code
     you want, using `topic.onEvent(...)`.
  4. You can subscribe to `azure.storage.Container` blob events, invoking a FunctionApp containing
     the code you want, using `container.onBlobEvent(...)`.
  5. You can subscribe to `azure.storage.Queue` events, invoking a FunctionApp containing
     the code you want, using `queue.onEvent(...)`.

## 0.18.0 (Released April 22nd, 2019)

## Breaking Changes

- `azure.api.API` has been renamed to `azure.api.Service`, and `azure.api.Api` now represents the Terraform `azure_api_management_api` resource.

## Improvements

- Updated to v1.25.0 of the AzureRM Terraform Provider.

## 0.17.4 (Released April 2nd, 2019)

## Improvements

## 0.17.3 (Released March 19th, 2019)

## Improvements

- Fix a bug where setting a property value back to the default results in no change

- Resources can no longer be "adopted" by accident during creation if another resources with the same ID already exists. This is akin to using `ARM_PROVIDER_STRICT` with the AzureRM Terraform Provider.

- Numeric types in Python are now projected as `float` instead of `int`, fixing some crashes.

## 0.17.2 (Released March 11th, 2019)

## Improvements

## 0.17.0 (Released March 5th, 2019)

### Important

Updating to v0.17.0 version of `@pulumi/pulumi`.  This is an update that will not play nicely
in side-by-side applications that pull in prior versions of this package.

See https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/commit/7f5e089f043a70c02f7e03600d6404ff0e27cc9d for more details.

As such, we are rev'ing the minor version of the package from 0.16 to 0.17.  Recent version of `pulumi` will now detect, and warn, if different versions of `@pulumi/pulumi` are loaded into the same application.  If you encounter this warning, it is recommended you move to versions of the `@pulumi/...` packages that are compatible.  i.e. keep everything on 0.16.x until you are ready to move everything to 0.17.x.

  const sa = new azure.storage.Account("storage", {
      resourceGroupName: rg.name,
      location: "EastUS",
  });

  ```ts
  const rg = new azure.core.ResourceGroup("rg");
  const sa = new azure.storage.Account("storage", {
      resourceGroupName: rg.name,
  });
  ```
  Location can then be set using the provider configuration block if using first class providers, or, for the default provider, by running:
  ```
  pulumi config set azure:location EastUS
  ```

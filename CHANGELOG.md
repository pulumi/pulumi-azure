* Update to v1.27.1 of the AzureRM Terraform provider
* Add support for authenticating with , , and
* Add support for authenticating with `clientCertificatePassword`, `clientCertificatePath`, and `partnerId`
* Add 'serverless' functionality in line with `@pulumi/aws`. Specifically:
  1. You can now easily create a FunctionApp from a JavaScript/TypeScript function using azure.appservice.CallbackFunctionApp.
  2. Subscribing and responding to HTTP events can be done easily with the new `azure.appservice.HttpEventSubsription` component. Custom routing is supported.
  3. You can subscribe to `azure.eventhub.Topic` events, invoking a FunctionApp containing the code you want, using `topic.onEvent(...)`.
  4. You can subscribe to `azure.storage.Container` blob events, invoking a FunctionApp containing the code you want, using `container.onBlobEvent(...)`.
  5. You can subscribe to `azure.storage.Queue` events, invoking a FunctionApp containin the code you want, using `queue.onEvent(...)`.
* The location for each resource attached to a provider instance is now set as part of the provider configuration. This means that the following code from v0.18.0:

  ```ts
  const rg = new azure.core.ResourceGroup("rg", { location" EastUS" });
  const sa = new azure.storage.Account("storage", {
      resourceGroupName: rg.name,
      location: "EastUS",
  });
  ```
  can now be written as:
  ```ts
  const rg = new azure.core.ResourceGroup("rg");
  const sa = new azure.storage.Account("storage", {
      resourceGroupName: rg.name,
  });
  ```
  Location can then be set using the provider configuration block if using first class providers, or, for the default provider, by running:
  ```
  pulumi config set azure:location EastUS
  ```

## 0.18.0 (2019-04-22)
